# Group-17---Currency-Arbitrage
As of 4/15/2017 the program: 
  - initializes an 8x8 matrix through the creation of a two dimensional array using double pointers
  - reads exchange rates (floating point numbers) from a text file and inserts them into our matrix
  - prints out the matrix with their newly assigned values

As of 4/25/2017 the program:
  - generates a simple weighted graph (there might be bugs associated with the edge weight assignments). 
  - no longer uses any of the previous matrix code. This is because of our decision in using a weighted graph in place of a matrix.
